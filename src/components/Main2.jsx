					Our goal is to help our clients enhance productivity and
					performance by being hands-on and working alongside yard and
					project teams when required. This adds not only operational
					but also financial advantages to the business. While we
					offer our own after-sales service consisting of extremely
					skilled and knowledgeable personnel who are product experts,
					we are also strongly backed by our manufacturers through
					inventory, engineering and training support. With offices,
					yard and warehouse space in the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
					AMRR is strategically located to easily service the GCC
					region in an industry which is undergoing continued
					expansion.
